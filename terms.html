This can be done by providing either credit/debit card or checking account information and all other relevant information necessary to process payments. All information submitted in connection with a User Account must be accurate and truthful. </p>

                <p>To create a Browse Only Account, you need to be at least 13 years old. To sign up for and to activate an Active User Account: </p>
                <p>1.  You must be 18 years or old enough to form a binding contract at where you live.</p>
                <p> 2.  You must provide a valid name that matches the name on your credit/debit card or checking account information, and any other payment information needed in order to process payment.</p>

                <p>5.  You are responsible for all activity and content (including but not limited to data, graphics, photos, links, videos) that is uploaded under your User Account</p>
                <p>6.  You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.</p>
                <p>7.  A breach or violation of any of these account terms as determined in the sole discretion of Vimpact will result in an immediate termination of your User Account.</p>

                <h4 class="block__subtitle">5. Relationship Between the Parties</h4>
                <p>When a Challenge is created/self-initiated, accepted (as the case may be) and funded, a legal contract between the participating Users is formed and Vimpact is not part of it.</p>
                <p>The contract is a direct legal agreement between the participating Users whether in the capacity as Challenger and/or Challengee and/or Funder and comprising the following terms.</p>
                <p>1.  Upon creation of a Challenge, Challenger shall make an initial pledge simultaneously;</p>
                <p>2.  A Challengee must set a funding goal upon acceptance of a Challenge OR initiation of a Challenge to oneself.</p>
                <p>3.  The funding goal cannot be changed once set.</p>
                <p>4.  When a Challenge is successfully funded, the Challengee <strong>must fulfill his obligation in manner as described in the Challenge and complete the Challenge</strong> by uploading the required number of Vimpact Visual at his sole costs and expenses within the time frame specified by the Challengee when the Challenge is accepted or self-initiated.</p>
                <p>5.  If Challengee is unable to complete the Challenge within the prescribed time, a final score of 25% will be automatically assigned to such Challengee and the Challengee will also be considered as in breach of the contract.</p>
                <p>6.  Vimpact Visuals will be voted and rated as a whole by each Funder within three days after the prescribed period for completing the Challenge. After the said period of three days, no voting and rating will be accepted. A no-vote will default to a "Yes: the Challenge has been completed".</p>
                <h4 class="block__subtitle"><u>For Visual Challenge:</u></h4>
                <p>1.  Challengee shall choose whether to link his Challenge to an Impact Challenge of his own choice upon his acceptance of a Challenge or initiation of a Challenge to oneself.</p>
                <p>2.  Once a Visual Challenge is linked to an Impact Challenge, it cannot be revoked.</p>
                <p>3.  When a Completion Score is achieved:</p>
                <p>i). A Challengee will be entitled to receive the funding subject to ii). below.</p>
                <p>ii).    If a Visual Challenge is linked to an Impact Challenge, the entire pledges will be transferred directly to the linked Impact Challenge forthwith and the transferred pledges shall become and form part of the pledges to the Impact Challenge and the Challengee shall have no interest entitlement and claim whatsoever in the transferred pledges.</p>
                <h4 class="block__subtitle"><u>For Impact Challenge:</u></h4>
                <p>If a Challengee is unable to complete the Challenge within the prescribed time and fulfill his obligation to obtain a Completion Score, he must remedy the situation by:</p>
                <p>1.  posting an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used and what prevents him from finishing the Challenge on time;</p>
                <p>2.  working diligently and in good faith to bring the Challenge to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that has communicated to Funders;</p>
                <p>3.  demonstrating that he has used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the Challenge;</p>
                <p>4.  making honest, and truthful representations in his communication to Funders; </p>
                <p>5.  explaining how those funds will be used to complete the Challenge in alternate form (if applicable); and</p>
                <p>6.  offer to refund any Funds that have been contributed towards a Challenge that can no longer be fulfilled. If not enough money remains for a full refund to each Funder, a Challengee must return an amount that reflects the percentage of each Funder's respective contributions.</p>
                <p>The Challengee is solely responsible for fulfilling the obligations made in the Challenge. If a Challengee is unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, he may be subject to legal action by Funders.</p>

                <h4 class="block__subtitle">6. Funding</h4>
                <p>All funding to a Challenge is to be paid exclusively through credit or debit card unless otherwise stated.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to hold a charge on your card after the funding goal for a Challenge is reached.  Vimpact and its payment partners may authorize or hold a charge on your credit card or debit card for any amount up to the full pledge, at any time between the pledge and the collection of funds.</p>
                <p>You can change or cancel your pledge at any time before the last 12 hours of the funding deadline of a Challenge.</p>
                <p>Vimpact does not offer refunds. Responsibility for completing a Challenge lies entirely with the Challengee. Vimpact does not hold funds on anyone’s behalf. We do not guarantee the completion or quality of any Challenge. Any disputes will be settled between the Funders and the Challengee.</p>
                <p>At no time does Vimpact warrant that your pledge is tax deductible.  Vimpact is not able to issue tax deductible receipts.  Vimpact has no control over the actions of third parties and consequently any receipts issued, and their tax deductible validity is a completely separate transaction between you and the third party.  You agree to release Vimpact from any claims arising from the issue of the tax deductibility of any pledges you make on Vimpact.</p>
                <h4 class="block__subtitle"><u>When you are funding a Visual Challenge:</u></h4>
                <p><strong>You are only charged if :</strong></p>
                <p><strong>i.  the Challenge funded by you reaches its funding goal;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>ii. all required number of Vimpact Visual are uploaded; and </strong></p>
                <p><strong>iii.    Completion Score is achieved. </strong></p>
                <h4 class="block__subtitle"><u>When you are funding an Impact Challenge or a Visual Challenge which is linked to an Impact Challenge:</u></h4>
                <p><strong>You are only charged if the Challenge funded by you or the linked Impact Challenge reaches its funding goal.</strong></p>

                <h4 class="block__subtitle">7. Collecting Fund</h4>
                <p>1.   <strong>Vimpact and its payment partners will subtract fees before putting funds in your account</strong> and you will not be billed.</p>
                <p>2.   Since some payments cannot be collected — for instance, when a Funder’s credit card expires before funding ends and he has not provided updated information — we therefore cannot and will not guarantee that the amount of fund you receive will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees.</p>
                <p><strong>In a Visual Challenge which is not linked to an Impact Challenge</strong>, proceeds minus fees will be transmitted to the Challengee ONLY IF a Completion Score is achieved.</p>
                <p><strong>In an Impact Challenge</strong>, proceeds minus fees will be transmitted to the Challengee when the Challenge reaches its funding goal.</p>

                <h4 class="block__subtitle">8. Responsibilities</h4>

                <h4 class="block__subtitle">21. Arbitration</h4>
                <p>We encourage you to contact us if you are having an issue so that we can resolve the matter quickly and informally. </p>
                <p>To the extent permitted by law, you agree to file any claim you may have against Vimpact within one year after such claim arose failing which your claim is permanently barred.</p>
                <p>If we cannot solve that dispute informally, you and Vimpact agree to resolve any claim against each other through final and binding arbitration, including any claim involving Vimpact’s affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, and its affiliates’ officers, directors, employees and agents. </p>
                <p>You and Vimpact agree to submit the dispute to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes or by separate mutual agreement to another arbitration institution. </p>
                <p>The AAA’s rules and a description of the arbitration process are available at <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.</p>
                <p>The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs shall be determined under the AAA rules. However, if the value of the relief sought is US$10,000 or less, you or Vimpact may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Vimpact subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Vimpact may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>
                <p>The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed US$10,000, at your request, Vimpact will reimburse you for all reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees, as long as the arbitrator determines that your claim is non-frivolous.  Any judgment on the award rendered by arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Services.</p>
                <p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of the Services.</p>
